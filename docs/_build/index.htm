<!--
What is this?
===============================================================================

This page is just a placeholder to let the developer know that they haven't yet
built their Sphinx docs yet (and instruct them on doing so). In general, it's
good practice to keep documentation artifacts out of version control so that
they don't become stale when someone forgets to build them.

This page will only appear if you haven't yet built your docs. Its extension is
`.htm` instead of `.html` to allow it to be served by nginx (with no additional
configuration) and excluded from .gitignore while still 
allowing the built docs themselves to be gitignored. We're basically taking
advantage of nginx's default index page priority.
